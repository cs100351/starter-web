You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. Congratulations, you played yourself. Hammock talk come soon. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it.
