They don’t want us to win. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch. Stay focused. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail.
