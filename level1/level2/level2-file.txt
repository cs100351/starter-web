Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. Special cloth alert. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Fan luv. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Fan luv. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.

Don’t ever play yourself. Give thanks to the most high. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. I’m up to something. Mogul talk. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile.
